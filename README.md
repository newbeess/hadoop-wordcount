# wordcount
It's a Hadoop WordCount project build by maven in intelij IDE.
You need not start hdfs ,because we can read file from project_path/inputfile
Only what you should do is set the Run/Debug Configrations->Main class(com.elephant.hadoop.WordCount),->Program arguments(input/ output/),Working directory(your own working directory)
Any questions,write issues or pull requests . 
Realy cool to learn together.
